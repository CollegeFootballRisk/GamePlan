# Timeline [DRAFT]

This document serves as a general timeline for the Summer Rust Risk game (hereafter, game). Changes may be submitted by PR. Please keep it to ~1 change/PR. 

## Timeline
- May 24: Moderator beta begins. Teams may open an issue on this GitHub or ping a mod on Discord for login information
- May 30: Moderator beta ends
- June 1: No/Go deadline: After this date, the game must proceed as scheduled in this timeline. Schedule changes thereafter require a 3/4 mod majority or [simple majority user poll](#definitions)
- June 7: Mechanics finalization deadline: After this date, the game mechanics may only be changed with a 3/4 mod majority or [simple majority user poll](#definitions).
- June 14: Open Source Deadline: Internal (negotiable) deadline for open sourcing the administration bot and the API integration bot
- June 16: API stabilization deadline (API endpoints may be added or changed, but should not have spurious changes)
- June 19: First Roll
- June 20: Day Off (Father's Day)
- June 21: Second Roll
- July 4: Day Off (Fourth of July)
- July 31: Final Roll (Day 40)

## Rationale
Starting the day before father's day and then taking the day off gives us time to correct any mistakes that occur on day 1 (most likely day for failures to be found). 
Generally, most people seemed to express boredom (and the game stagnated) around day 40 in the past. We therefore will go with a 40-day season. 

## Definitions
- **Simple Majority User Poll**: A poll of all users on the game, wherein each team gets a single yes/no/abstain vote. All votes from a team's users are tallied, and then cast as a team vote: yea (50%user+1), nay (50%user-1), or abstain (50%user). Such changes need only a simple majority of teams to approve the change (50%team+1). Abstentions are discarded as non-votes. The process for triggering a poll shall be agreed to in a separate document.
