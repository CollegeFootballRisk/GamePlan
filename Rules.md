## Objective

To have as many territories as possible at the end of the regular season.

  

Side Quests:

-   Eliminate your rivals
    
-   Take over your state
    
-   Keep home territory all regular season

-   Whatever else your team cares about
    

## Setup

1.  All 130 of the college football teams in the FBS are assigned their home territory as it would be on the map.
    
2.  A second map, with no teams, shall also be created. Eliminated teams shall be placed on the secondary map. Once a team has been eliminated from both maps, their players may join a new team active on either map.
    

  

## Gameplay

1.  **Turns.** Each team player shall be able to submit a single turn for each round. The player may attack any unowned territory immediately adjacent to a territory that the player's team owns. The player may also defend any attackable territory owned by the player’s team. For defending a territory, the player shall receive a 1.5x (which is 50%) defense bonus.
    
2.  **Rolls.** At 22:00 U.S. Central Standard Time on every day but Sunday, a new round shall begin. This shall consist of the Rust Risk program deciding the owner of each territory according to the following plan:
    

	1.  If a territory is owned by a team, and that territory is not attacked by any other team, that territory shall remain owned by the defending team regardless of whether the defending team placed players on that territory.
	    
	2.  If a territory has both attacking and defending players, then the total amount of power (which is star power times bonuses) for each team will be calculated and mapped to a random number to determine the winner. See “Star Power Specifics by Map.”
    

3.  **MVPs.** Once a territory has been assigned to an owner, a player on that territory who played for the winning team shall be selected to serve as the MVP for that team and territory pair. That player shall have their MVP count incremented by one. In the case that no players were placed on a territory, no MVPs will be assigned (e.g. a territory and its surrounding territories all owned by the same team prior to the roll).
       
4.  **Elimination.** A team is eliminated when it no longer owns any territories.
    
5.  **Ranking.** Rankings for the regular season shall be determined first by number of territories owned, then by number of days in the game.

6.  **Kills.** If a player made a move on a territory owned by a team that is eliminated that turn, that player shall be given a "kill". 

7.  **Chaos.** Players who do not choose to align themselves with one of the FBS teams can instead choose to join Chaos. Unlike other teams, Chaos players will not receive a defense bonus but will be assigned as a team a random attack multiplier for each turn chosen from the following equally-weighted set: {1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2}.

8.  **Star Power.** The total star power for a player each turn will be (sum of bonuses) times (star number power); see below for star number.  

9.  **Alts.** Alts are prohibited; players flagged as an alt will be warned, receive directions for remedy/contest, and receive a 0x multiplier.

### Star

A player’s stars shall again be determined by five different categories: eliminated teams, streak, total turns in all college football risk games, total turns in this season, total number of MVPs in all college football risk games. The user’s star number (for determining star power) shall be determined according to the median value of stars for each category, where the star values for each category are as follows:

-  Kills
    
	A.  0 eliminated teams: 1 star
    
	B.  1 eliminated team: 2 stars
	    
	C.  2 eliminated teams: 3 stars
	    
	D.  3 eliminates teams: 4 stars
	    
	E.  4+ eliminated teams: 5 stars
    

-  Streak
    

	A.  0-2 turns: 1 star
	    
	B.  3-4 turns: 2 stars
	    
	C.  5-9 turns: 3 stars
	    
	D.  10-24 turns: 4 stars
	    
	E.  25+ turns: 5 stars
    

-  Total Turns
    

	A.  0-9 turns: 1 star
	    
	B.  10-24 turns: 2 stars
	    
	C.  25-49 turns: 3 stars
	    
	D.  50-99 turns: 4 stars
	    
	E.  100+ turns+: 4 stars
    

-  Season Turns
    
	
	A.  0-4 turns: 1 star
	    
	B.  5-9 turns: 2 stars
	    
	C.  10-24 turns: 3 stars
	    
	D.  25-39 turns: 4 stars
	    
	E.  40+ turns: 5 stars
    

-  Total MVPs
    

	A.  0 MVPs: 1 star
	    
	B.  1-4 MVPs: 2 stars
	    
	C.  5-9 MVPs: 3 stars
	    
	D.  10-24 MVPs: 4 stars
	    
	E.  25+ MVPs+: 5 stars
    

  

The star number power each player shall receive will be according to the star number (median for each of the above categories) and the assignments below:

-  1 star: 1 point
    
-  2 stars: 2 points
    
-  3 stars: 6 points
    
-  4 stars: 12 points
    
-  5 stars: 24 points
    

  

## Recruiting Guidelines

In order to win this game, you will need to have one of, if not the biggest player base in the game. That is why recruiting is essential. The easiest way to recruit is to ask your friends and classmates to play.

Do:

-   Get the word out to as many people as you can
    
-   Make joining a painless experience - it takes about two minutes to create a Reddit or Discord account!
    
-   Look at other subreddits, Discord servers, GroupMes, Facebook groups, and any other social media to find people
    
-   Text or drop a line to friends of yours.
    

Don’t:

-   Create alt accounts. That’s not recruiting, that’s cheating.
    
-   Break Reddit’s Terms of Service, or the TOS of any other website.
    
-   Spam or otherwise annoy people.
    
-   Shame anyone for not wanting to join.
    
-   Recruit people who like trolling others.
    
-   Offer bribes to people or otherwise act dishonestly.
    
-   Recruit in person. Please cooperate with your city and state health officials in these uncertain times. Stay home and stay healthy.
