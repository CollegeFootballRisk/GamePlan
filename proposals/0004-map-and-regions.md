## Rationale

This serves two purposes:
1. It adds 11 territories to the Northeast Canada region, which previously had only 9, the lowest in the game, despite also being one of the easiest regions to acquire and hold. 
2. This change adds and tweaks several bridges throughout the map to add strategic balance, increase mobility in a rational way, and limit near-unbreakable safe zones in future games. Most of the bridges intentionally go from a highly-contested area to a corner of the map, and not from corner to corner. Also allows for more equal access to colonizeable territories at the start of the game, if that idea is implemented in further games.
